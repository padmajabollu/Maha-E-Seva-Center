		The State of Maharashtra started the CSC implementation in September 2008 by appointing four
 SCAs, viz, CMS Computers, Reliance Communications, Spanco and 3i Infotech, to rollout 1181 CSCs across the State.
 It was envisaged that each CSC would cater to 4 villages. However, in January 2011, in place of 3i Infotech,
Bharat Samruddhi Finance Ltd. (BASIX) was selected in its place.</p>

	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		As of October 2012, 10518 CSCs have been rolled out in the State, with over 75% having connectivity.
		Setup Maharashtra, the State Designated Agency has taken a number of steps to make a number of
 G2C services available to the citizens via the CSCs, including 96 Revenue Department services, land records,
ration card and employment exchange services. Already over 22 lakh G2C certificates and affidavits have been
issued through CSCs. Currently test runs are being conducted for delivery of e-District services as well. UID
enrolment in the State is also taking place through the CSCs.</p>

	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		Further, the SCAs have taken a proactive step to offer a range of B2C services including IRCTC
services, electricity bill collection, insurance sale and premium collection, mobile sim sales and recharges,
DTH services and online job registration. Currently a few districts are offering Pension services as well.
 Education is a key service that is being successfully delivered through CSCs in the State. SCAs have tied up
 with the Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation (MKCL), to offer the popular MS-CIT computer course. Currently,
 the State is enabling, various Banks to leverage the CSC network to offer banking services to ensure financial
inclusion amongst its citizens.
