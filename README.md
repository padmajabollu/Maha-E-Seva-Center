    Our project is to develop a Maha E Seva Centre website portal. The main objective of our project is to provide services of Maha e seva center through website portal. That is instead of going physically in Maha E seva center, shop users can upload the documents from anywhere by using our website. This is only for verification purposes. Admin will verify all documents and send feedback to users to Email through the website. Hence any one can use the services of MAHA E SEVA center from any location.
    The website includes a payment gateway for payment of services and also provides bills through Email. Our clients could be students, citizens and anyone who require Certificates such as a caste certificate,7/12,cast validity, income certificate etc.
